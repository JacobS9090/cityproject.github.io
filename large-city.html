         <b>Austin, Texas was founded in 1836 and was to be the capital of at the time the Lone Star 
         Republic. It was named in honor of Stephen Austin a man who was given the job by the Mexican Government
         to bring at least 300 families into Lone Star State he is credited to be the founder of Texas. The Revolution partially started after Austin tried to make a compromise over Mexican authorities 
         about the influx of slaves in the state, Mexico had banned slavery when it was free from Spain in 1821. When Austin went down to make the compromise he was 
         jailed by Mexican authorities which contributed to the Texas revolution.After the successful Texas Revolution in which Mexico declared Texas free from Mexican 
         control at the Battle of San Jacinto. Austin was freed from imprisonment and the capital was selected and in his honor.  Though growth did not stop there as Austin played a large role on international trade through 
         trains and the railroads north and south of the Rio Grande.
